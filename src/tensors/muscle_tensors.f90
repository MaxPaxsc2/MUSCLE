    !! Tensors Types Module
    !! ====================
    !!
    !! This module serves as the central access point for various tensor types.
    !! 
    !! This module serves as the central access point for various tensor types and their associated
    !! operations within the MUSCLE library. It aggregates tensor definitions and operator
    !! implementations from specialized submodules, providing a unified interface for users.
    !!
    !! Instead of defining the tensor types and operations directly, this module uses other
    !! modules (`muscle_tensor_*`) and makes specific types and
    !! operators publicly available. This promotes modularity and organization within the library.
    !!
    !! Nomenclature
    !! ------------
    !!
    !! The module exposes two main categories of tensor types: Regular Tensors and Identity Tensors.
    !!
    !! ### Regular Tensors:
    !!
    !! Nomenclature `ten_xyz`:
    !!
    !! - `x`: Dimensions of the tensor (e.g., 3D, 2D)
    !! - `y`: Order of the tensor (e.g., 2O, 4O)
    !! - `z`: Number of symmetries of the tensor (e.g., sym, 2sym, 3sym)
    !!
    !! `2D` tensors describe plane (strain/stress) or axisymmetric states: the
    !! out-of-plane coupling components (13, 23, 31, 32) vanish, but the
    !! out-of-plane normal component (33) is kept.
    !!
    !! Examples:
    !!
    !! - `ten_3D2O`: 3D tensor, second order, no specific symmetry assumed in the type name (likely stored as 3x3).
    !! - `ten_3D2Osym`: 3D tensor, second order, symmetric (likely stored efficiently, e.g., 6 components).
    !! - `ten_3D4O2sym`: 3D tensor, fourth order, with minor symmetries (\(C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl} = C_{ijlk}\)).
    !! - `ten_3D4O3sym`: 3D tensor, fourth order, with major and minor symmetries (\(C_{ijkl} = C_{jikl} = C_{ijlk} = C_{klij}\)).
    !! - `ten_2D2Osym`: 2D symmetric second-order tensor (4 components: 11, 22, 33, 12).
    !! - `ten_2D2O`: 2D general second-order tensor (5 components: 11, 21, 12, 22, 33).
    !!
    !! ### Identity Tensors:
    !!
    !! Nomenclature `iden_xyz` or `iden_xyzS`:
    !!
    !! - `x`: Dimensions of the tensor (e.g., 3D)
    !! - `y`: Order of the tensor (e.g., 2O, 4O)
    !! - `z`: Type of identity (e.g., None, 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T)
    !!     * `None`: Standard second-order identity tensor \(\delta_{ij}\). (`iden_2O`)
    !!     * `1T`: \(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}\), only valid for a fourth order tensor.
    !!     * `2T`: \(\delta_{il}\delta_{jk}\), only valid for a fourth order tensor.
    !!     * `3T`: \(\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}\), only valid for a fourth order tensor. (`iden_4O3T`)
    !!     * `4T`: \(\frac{\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk}}{2}\), symmetric fourth-order identity. (`iden_4O4T`)
    !! - `S`: Suffix indicating a *scaled* identity tensor (e.g., `val * identity`). (`iden_2OS`, `iden_4O3TS`, `iden_4O4TS`)
    !!
    !! Examples:
    !!
    !! - `iden_2O`: 3D identity tensor, second order (\(\delta_{ij}\)).
    !! - `iden_2OS`: Scaled 3D identity tensor, second order (\(c \delta_{ij}\)).
    !! - `iden_4O3T`: 3D identity tensor, fourth order, type 3 (\(\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}\)).
    !! - `iden_4O4T`: 3D identity tensor, fourth order, type 4 (symmetric identity).
    !! - `iden_4O4TS`: Scaled 3D identity tensor, fourth order, type 4 (\(c \cdot (\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk})/2\)).
    !!

    !!
    !! ### Operators:
    !!
    !! The following operators are overloaded for various combinations of the public tensor types
    !! and intrinsic types (like `real(real64)`). The implementations are provided by the
    !! `mod_operator_*` modules.
    !!
    !! - `+`: Addition (e.g., `tensor + tensor`).
    !! - `-`: Subtraction (e.g., `tensor - tensor`).
    !! - `*`: Multiplication (scalar * tensor, tensor * scalar, potentially tensor * tensor depending on definitions).
    !! - `/`: Division (tensor / scalar).
    !! - `.approx.`: Custom equality comparison for tensors (checks for approximate equality of components).
    !! - `.dev.`: Deviatoric part of a second-order tensor.
    !! - `.ddot.`: Double dot product (e.g., `tensor4 : tensor2`, `tensor2 : tensor2`).
    !! - `.tdot.`: Tensor dot product (specific definition depends on implementation, often \( (A \otimes B)_{ijkl} = A_{ij} B_{kl} \) for second order).
    !! - `.inv.`: Inverse of a tensor (every `ten_*` type, also as the method `%inv()`); quiet NaN if singular.
    !! - `inverse`: `call inverse(a, a_inv, ok [, cond])`, inverse with a success flag and the condition number.
    !! - `.tdotsym.`: Symmetrized dyadic product \( \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{a}) \).
    !! - `.transform.`: Congruence transformation \( \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{F}^T \) (2nd and 4th order).
    !! - `transpose`: Transpose of a general second-order tensor.
    !!
    !! ### Assignment:
    !!
    !! - `=`: Overloaded assignment allows copying between compatible tensor types.
    !!
    !! Usage
    !! -----
    !!
    !! To use the tensor types and operations defined here, simply add `use muscle_tensors`
    !! to your Fortran code.
    !!
    !! ```fortran
    !! program example_usage
    !!   use muscle_tensors
    !!   implicit none
    !!
    !!   type(ten_3D2Osym) :: stress, strain, stress_dev
    !!   type(ten_3D4O3sym) :: C_elastic
    !!   real(real64) :: scalar_val
    !!
    !!   ! ... initialize tensors ...
    !!
    !!   stress = C_elastic .ddot. strain  ! Double dot product via overloaded operator
    !!   stress_dev = .dev. stress   ! Deviatoric part

    !!

    !!
